# dot.emacs

This repository contains my Emacs configuration files and some emacs packages stored in the .emacs.d directory for Mac and Linux.

## Installation
Fist of all, simply download dot.emacs from this site by clinking the green button "Clone or download" or directly clone it on Terminal as follows:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/naohisas/dot.emacs.git
```
### dot.emacs
Copy ".emacs" and ".emacs.d" to your home directory.
```
$ cd dot.emacs
$ cp -a .emacs* ~/
```
Change the following local variables in ~/.emacs to your name and email address.
```cl:.emacs
;; Set local variables
(setq user-full-name Â   "Your name")
(setq user-mail-address "Your email address")
```
### Emacs in Mac OS
Older version of Emacs (Emacs22) is iinstalled by default with Mac OS. So it is suggested you to install new one on your Mac.
<br><br>
New Emcas (Emacs 25.1) can be installed with Homebrew in Mac.
```
$ brew tap caskroom/cask
$ brew cask install emacs
```
The installed Emacs.app can be opened from Terminal.
```
$ open -a /Application/Emacs.app
```
The following alias is optional, but it's recommended if you like to start by typing 'emacs' on Terminal. Create a alias in your shell. To make it permanent, put that line to your .profile (or .bash_profile, etc) at home directory
```
$ alias emacs="open -a /Applications/Emacs.app"
```

## Customization
Appearance of emacs can be changed by modifying ~/.emacs.d/listp/config_appearance.el.
<br><br>
To change colors (foreground, background, etc.), modify the frame parameters in the variable 'default-frame-alist'
```cl:config_appearance.el
(setq default-frame-alist
      (append
       (list
        '(top . 0)
        '(left . 0)
        '(foreground-color . "black")
        '(background-color . "wheat")
        '(border-color .     "black")
        '(mouse-color .      "white")
        '(cursor-color .     "black"))
       default-frame-alist))
```
Mode line color can be changed as follows:
```cl:config_appearance.el
(set-face-foreground 'mode-line "#ffffff")
(set-face-background 'mode-line "#b40000")
```
