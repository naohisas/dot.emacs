# dot.emacs

This repository contains my Emacs configuration files and some emacs packages stored in the .emacs.d directory for Mac and Linux.

## Installation
### dot.emacs
Copy .emacs and .emacs.d to your home directory.
```
$ cp -a .emacs* ~/
```
Change local variables in ~/.emacs.
```
;; Set local variables
(setq user-full-name Â   "Your name")
(setq user-mail-address "Your email address")
```
Appearance of emacs can be changed by modifying ~/.emacs.d/listp/config_appearance.el.
